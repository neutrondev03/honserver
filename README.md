You need to have the original honserver installed from the honserver github repo: [Download link honserver](https://github.com/honserver/honserver/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)


# How to download and use
Press the Code button -> Download as zip. Or
[PATCH](https://github.com/neutrondev03/honserver/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
Replace the k2_x64.dll in the <hon_server> folder.
Replace the game_x64.dll in the <hon_server>/game folder.

This modification is only needed if you HOST the game on the SERVER SIDE.

# Fixes required for a nice gaming experience
Things to get fixed:
1. Ping/team chat for everyone not only the last player
2. All game modes
3. Server discovery
4. TBD

# DISCLAIMER
I am not responsible for how people use this or how they distribute it. I did it only for my own research and educational purposes. This is my own research on how the dlls work, starting from the initial honserver. It is 100% based off the original client files.
